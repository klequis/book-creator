## 3.2 The Router Component

The `<Router>` component is a top-level component that manages the routing of your application. It does not create any routes. It takes an array of route objects that can be created with any of the three available methods for creating routes (component-based, configuration-based, and file-based).

We will be configuring routing in `app.jsx`.

1. Import `Router` from @solidjs/router.
2. Add `<Router>` to the function return:

{title: "app.jsx"}

```jsx
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import './app.css'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div class="app">
      <div 
        class="filename-lg">
          app.jsx
      </div>
      <Router />
    </div>
  )
}
```
