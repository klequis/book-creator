## 2.2 Open and Run the Starter Project

{blurb, class: tip}
If you haven't already done so, downloaded the example code. Instructions are in the *Introduction* chapter under the section *Example Code*.

1. In a terminal, `cd` into `solid-start-routing`.
2. Install the dependencies:

```console
# pnpm
pnpm install

# npm
npm install
```

4. Run the code:

```console
# pnpm
pnpm dev

# npm
npm run dev
```

In your terminal, you will see the URL to use in your browser. My port is `3000`. Yours may differ. Enter what is on your screen.

Here is the application running. It doesn't look like much yet, but that will change as we progress through this chapter.
