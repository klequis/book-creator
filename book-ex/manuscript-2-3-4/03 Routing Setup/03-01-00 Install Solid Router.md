## 3.1 Install the Router

The starter project does not have the Solid Router package installed. Install it now.

1. In your terminal, make sure you are in the root of `/solid-start-routing`.
2. Execute one of the below commands depending on which package manager you are using:

```shell
# pnpm
pnpm install @solidjs/router

# npm
npm install @solidjs/router
```
{blurb, class: information}

As we proceed through the following steps you may get an error in your console or browser. These can be safely ignored. I will let you know once things are sufficiently configured and should be working.

- not all of them can be compared.
- Say something like ignore them until done and what to do if there are errors when done.
